# Introduction

Nuxt Naive UI is an unofficial module for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) that aims to provide a complete UI layer based on [Naive UI](https://www.naiveui.com/) Vue 3 component library.

- Complete, as It provides +80 Naive UI components, +150k Iconify icons, built-in dark mode support, and more.
- Lightweight, as it provides tree-shakable components and no-static CSS implementation for minimal bundle size.
- Customizable, as it supports granular theme configuration via JavaScript based on color mode and device type.
- Pleasant DX, as it's built with typescript and provides [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) types definition for intellisense.

::: tip
The official `naive-ui` module for Nuxt was recently created and can be found [here](https://github.com/07akioni/nuxtjs-naive-ui).
