# NaiveIcon

This component is a wrapper of [Iconify Vue](https://iconify.design/getting-started/) which provides a collection of over 100 icon sets. FYI the module uses `Phosphor` icon set.

[Icônes](https://icones.js.org) can be used for exploration and instant search.

### Offline

By default icons are fetched at runtime from Iconify API. By setting `iconDownload` config option to `true`, icons can be downloaded and stored locally to `public/iconify` directory. This takes place only at production build. The advantages are:

- ✔️ On server side no need for network calls thus better loading time.
- ✔️ Takes benefit from Iconify client & server side caching (localStorage & memory).
- ✔️ Build offline applications.

In order for the module to find the used icons in your application, first it needs to collect all the existant icon sets. This takes place via a fetch request to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iconify/icon-sets/master/collections.json`. In case of network access limitations, it's possible to provide a custom proxy URL via `iconCollectionsUrl` config option.
