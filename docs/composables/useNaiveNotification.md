# useNaiveNotification

This composable is intended to support `useNotification` usage on Nuxt plugins. Make sure to add `naive-notification` as a child of `n-notification-provider`.

```vue
<template>
  <n-notification-provider>
    <naive-notification />
  </n-notification-provider>
</template>
```
