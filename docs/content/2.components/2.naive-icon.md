# NaiveIcon

This component is a wrapper of [Iconify Vue](https://iconify.design/getting-started/) which provides a collection of over 100 icon sets. FYI the module uses `Phosphor` icon set.

[Icônes](https://icones.js.org) can be used for exploration and instant search.

### Props

| **Name**     | **Type** | **Default**        | **Note**                        |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| name         | string   | undefined          | This property is reactive       |
| size         | number   | `naiveui.iconSize` | Should be in `px`               |
| iconColor    | string   | undefined          | Color of icon                   |
| color        | string   | undefined          | Background color of the wrapper |
| borderRadius | number   | undefined          | Border radius of the wrapper    |

### Offline

By default icons are fetched at runtime from Iconify API. By setting `iconDownload` config option to `true`, icons can be downloaded and stored locally to `public/iconify` directory. This takes place only at built. The advantages are:

- ✔️ On server side no need for network calls thus better loading time.
- ✔️ On client side no need to rely on Iconify API thus better security.
- ✔️ Takes benefit from Iconify client & server side caching (localStorage & memory).
- ✔️ Build offline applications.
